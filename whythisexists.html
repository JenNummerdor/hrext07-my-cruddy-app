			<h3>Health is Multi-Faceted</h3>
				<p>When people think of health, they often think of the state of their body or the types of food they eat. There is
					much more to health than this simple subscription,
					and it can be helpful to be honest with oneself about the state of one's health. People tend to over/underestimate
					the true condition of their well-being, and so this
					website is an attempt to show meaningful data to aid in self-assessment. When we take stock of our health and
					reflect on what contributes to it, we can become happier
					and more productive.
					<br>
					It should certainly be noted that I am quite new to the realm of programming. This website is an oversimplistic
					idea of a more comprehensive app.
					<h3>Personal Experience</h3>
					<p>The reason that I created this website grows out of personal experience. I am someone who has suffered from 
						a difficult childhood and was only able to heal through extensive amounts of therapy. One of the most impactful 
						ways that  I improved my mental health was to keep an accurate collection of data on my habits. Originally, I tracked this 
						data each day and reviewed my improvements and failures and their direct impacts on my mental health daily. I have found
						that by keeping track of my habits, I feel less depressed and less anxious than I would otherwise. It is not a system
						that works for everyone, but can provide a mirror to those who think they could be feeling better.
