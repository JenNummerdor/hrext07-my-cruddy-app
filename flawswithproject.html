			<h3>I've made a lot of Mistakes!</h3>
			<p>I have not kept this code DRY. Some of this is due to lack of knowledge, and some of this is due to
				functionality. C3 is a strange graph library and
				has proven to be a bit finicky.
				<br>
				Please email suggestions to <a href="mailto:jennifer.nummerdor@gmail.com">me!</a>
				<br>
				<h3> What is happening when I click the drop down menu multiple times?</h3>
				<p>Great Question! I currently have set up the code to add each date when the add button is clicked on. It will
					empty whenever you click ANYWHERE ELSE
					in the document. The problem is that it will continue adding the dates to edit over and over again once you click
					on it. It does not impact functionality
					but it looks terrifying to watch these dates multiply each time they're clicked on.</p>
			</p>
			<h3>Why Doesn't The Graph Refresh Itself?</h3>
			<p> Ah yes, a problem I spent quite a bit of time trying to fix. In some cases, the graph will refresh itself as
				intended. However, sometimes it will do
				funky things and will update immediately with inaccurate data. I've scoured forums trying to fix this-it seems to
				be a common problem. I intend to re-write
				this in react once I know how to do so!
			</p>
			<h3>Is ALL of this Hard-Coded?</h3>
			<p>YES! It is hard-coded and definitely redundant and at this time will only work for the year 2019! I plan on
				fixing it, but the code is rough for sure. </p>
