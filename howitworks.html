			<h3>Intended Purpose</h3>
			<p>Each week, log your data. It will store in your local memory. Currently, the data is based on a
				subjective rubric, so answer the questions as best as you can. The questions that
				were chosen for this project are examples, and the rubrics to grade them are subjective. Feel free to
				edit them to your own benefit.
			</p>
			<h3>Language</h3>
			<p>This was written in jQuery with some Javascript elements. I wanted to use Bootstrap as well so that I
				didn't have to worry about CSS.
				I also used C3 which generates graphs of data. This visual is nice to compare data week-by-week. The
				goal is to get the user to begin to notice trends in the data to see how to see
				which health goals they are exceeding and which ones can be improved upon.
			</p>
			<h3>Statistical Data</h3>
			<p>The data derived for the statistics part of this page was calculated using an example from
				<a href ="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/correlation.html"> this link</a>. If you have further suggestions on
				how to improve the correlateive data for this project, please let me know! I'm well aware that using 
				subjective rubric data is not ideal, but this is only a stepping stone to a more accurate goal.
				I don't come from a math background, but I find it to be fascinating, so enlighten me if you have improvements
				you would like to suggest.
